    with minors in "Entrepreneurship and business". I am doing my
    studies in “EIT Digital Master School”, where I will obtain a
    double-degree from two universities which I have studied in: Aalto
    University in Finland, and TU Delft in the Netherlands. Currently, I
    am working at Nokia Bell Labs, in Finland, as a thesis writer. In
    this position, I am conducting a research study on containerizing of
    a current telco IoT publish/subscribe application, and suitability
    of Kubernetes to be used for its deployment. Docker, Kubernetes,
    Nokia’s cloud environment (NESC), Apache Kafka and GIT are
    technologies and tools which I am using during my work in Nokia.'
